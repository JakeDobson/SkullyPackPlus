iMessage Sticker Pack made in collaboration with artist Mike Mitchell. Craving a custom layout, making it an iMessage app extension was necessary. Using Swift and the Messages framework, I subclassed a collection view to be presented instead of the default view and made a custom cell to enable it for drag and drop functionalities. Each sticker was added to the project as a PNG, created as stickers, and stored in an array of stickers. Will be in the app store soon!
